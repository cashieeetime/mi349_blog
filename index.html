    <h2>Swamp House</h2>

    <p>This swamp house is mostly a replica of a build made by Zaypixel, which I will link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2fvHwCSGbk&t=928s">here</a>. Her build is made over a normal lake, but I have chosen to put mine in a swamp biome. She also has another build on her channel of a house she specifically made for a swamp biome.</p>

    <h2>Classic Brick Cottage</h2>
    <p>Posted by <a href="about.html">cashie</a>, on October 16th, 2022</p>
    <img src="brick.png" alt="Brick house with seating in front, and a farm to the left" class="image">

    <p>This is a simple brick starter house that is aesthetic and small enough for one person. The farm on the right is an old fashioned one, with a simple roof to protect your crops. The interior of the first floor is open, with a bookshelf nook in the corner. The bedroom is up in the attic, with glass windows on the ceiling.</p>
