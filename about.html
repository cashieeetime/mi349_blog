<h1>Cashie Creates</h1>
<h2>Hi, I'm Cashie.</h2>
<p>I'm a junior in college studying information science. I like games, anime, coding and/or web development, and coffee. I started doing Minecraft builds sometime in the summer of the dreaded covid year of 2020, and soon after that I dove right into redstone engineering. Now, I'm using my builds as content for my web development class. Oh, and to share them too.</p>
