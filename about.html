<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Hi, I'm Cashie.</h2>
<p>I'm a junior in college studying information science. Some things I like are: 
    <ul>
        <li>Videogames</li>
        <li>Anime</li>
        <li>Coding and Web Development</li>
        <li>Fanfiction</li>
        <li>Coffee</li>
    </ul>I started doing Minecraft builds sometime in the summer of the dreaded covid year of 2020, and soon after that I dove right into redstone engineering. Now, I'm using my builds as content for my web development class. Oh, and to share them too.</p>

    <p>Bonus: Here's a picture of my doggo :) <img src="buster.jpg" alt="white terrier mix dog sitting under a table" class="image">
